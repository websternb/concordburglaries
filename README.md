  Growing up in Concord, CA, claycord.com was one of the main local news sites that us as a community visited for the local area. Claycord comes from the name of the two neighboring towns Clayton, CA and Concord, CA. Clayton being a small town, some residents of eastern Concord identify with the Clayton community, so this website covers details from Clayton, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Martinez, all in California.

 This map was done adding markers on my JavaScript code in Atom referencing coordinates of the addresses that were burglarized. Once the map was created and the markers were added, I made sure each marker would display a message once moused over that references the address of the burglaries. As a community, we used to read these reports every week from this website, so being able to map out the geographic locations of one of these maps was quite rewarding.
